About this project
This repository is not a basic "click-and-assert" automation suite. It is a scalable, production-style QA Automation Framework built with Kotlin + Serenity BDD + Cucumber + Screenplay Pattern, designed to reflect how automation is actually architected inside mature QA / SDET teams.
It demonstrates, in a single codebase, the ability to:
Design a layered, framework-style architecture (not just test scripts).
Apply SOLID principles to test automation code, the same discipline expected from a software engineer.
Automate both API and Web (E2E UI) layers with a shared, unified core.
Produce traceable, BDD-readable requirements (Gherkin) that any stakeholder — technical or not — can understand.
Generate professional, evidence-based reporting (Serenity HTML reports + recorded execution videos + screenshots).
This project was built to show a hiring manager or technical recruiter how I think about quality as a mindset, not as an afterthought: maintainability, reusability, traceability and clear separation of concerns are treated as first-class requirements, exactly as they would be in a real product team.

🎥 Execution Evidence
All execution evidence (videos and screenshots) is stored inside the `evidence/` folder of this repository, covering both automation suites: Web UI and API.
Web UI Automation (SauceDemo)
📹 Video: `evidence/videos/web-execution.mp4`
Shows the full Selenium/Serenity execution of the login, cart and checkout scenarios running against `https://www.saucedemo.com` in a real Chrome browser.
API Automation (ReqRes)
📹 Video: `evidence/videos/api-execution.mp4`
Shows the REST Assured + Serenity execution of the Login, Register and Get User API scenarios against `https://reqres.in`.
Report Screenshot

Screenshot of the generated Serenity Single Page HTML Report, showing test results, requirements traceability and step-by-step execution detail.
> 💡 *Tip for recruiters:* you can also generate this report yourself locally by running `./gradlew test` — it will be created at `target/site/serenity/index.html`.

Architecture
The framework follows a clean, layered architecture that separates what is being tested (requirements), how the actor performs it (Screenplay business logic) and how it talks to the system under test (low-level driver/HTTP layer).

```
Design highlights:
Screenplay Pattern instead of classic Page Objects only: Actors (`Ana`) perform `Tasks` and ask `Questions`, which makes scenarios read like real user behavior and keeps step definitions thin.
Single module, dual suite: API and Web share the same `build.gradle`, the same `serenity.conf` and the same reporting pipeline, while staying fully decoupled at the package level (`com.test.suites.api` vs `com.test.suites.web`).
Centralized configuration: `serenity.conf` defines environments, WebDriver capabilities (headless toggle, Chrome flags, incognito, disabled password manager) and reporting format (`single-page-html`).

🧱 SOLID principles applied to test automation
SRP (Single Responsibility): each class has one reason to exist — one Target/locator repository, one request builder, one logger factory, one `Task` per business action.
OCP (Open/Closed): new `Tasks` / `Questions` can be added for new features without touching existing ones.
DIP (Dependency Inversion): Step Definitions depend on Screenplay abstractions (`Task`, `Question`, `Ability`) — never directly on REST Assured or Selenium WebDriver.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
`AuthRequestBodyBuilder` centralizes JSON body creation for auth requests.
`withCommonApiHeaders()` / `withJsonBody()` centralize HTTP header logic.
`Loggers.of(...)` removes repeated logger boilerplate across classes.
A single `LastApiResponse` ability replaces duplicated `SerenityRest` calls.

⚙️ Tech stack & versions
Component	Version
Kotlin	1.9.23
Serenity BDD	4.2.30
Cucumber JVM	7.15.0
JUnit	4.13.2
SLF4J	2.0.9
REST Assured	5.4.0
AssertJ	3.24.2
Allure	2.29.0
WebDriverManager	5.8.0
JVM target	Java 21 (Kotlin toolchain)
System requirements to run it locally:
Java 21 (JDK) installed and configured (`JAVA_HOME`).
Google Chrome installed (required for the Web UI suite — WebDriverManager resolves the matching ChromeDriver automatically).
Internet connection (for Gradle dependency resolution and WebDriverManager's first run).
No local Gradle installation needed — the project ships with the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew` / `gradlew.bat`).

---

🚀 How to run the project
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/torrestadriana-hash/quality-mindset-portfolio.git
cd quality-mindset-portfolio

# Run the API suite only (REST Assured against reqres.in)
./gradlew apiTest

# Run the Web suite only (Selenium/Chrome against saucedemo.com)
./gradlew webTest

# Run the full regression suite (API + Web)
./gradlew test
```
After execution, open the generated report at:
```
target/site/serenity/index.html
```
> On Windows, replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`.
> By default, `headless.mode = false` in `serenity.conf`, so the Chrome browser will open visibly during the Web suite — set it to `true` for CI/headless execution.

🧩 Test suites overview
API suite — `com.test.suites.api.*`, executed against `https://reqres.in/api`:
✅ User Registration: success and validation failures (missing password, missing email).
✅ User Login: success, missing password, unregistered email.
✅ Get User: existing user (200) and non-existing user (404).
Web suite — `com.test.suites.web.*`, executed against `https://www.saucedemo.com`:
✅ Login: valid credentials and locked-out user.
✅ Cart: add single and multiple products, badge count validation.
✅ Checkout: full purchase flow with order confirmation.
Both suites use Gherkin feature files as living documentation, making the scenarios understandable to QA, Dev and Product stakeholders alike.

💬 Why this matters for my next role
This project was built to show, in practice, the mindset I bring to a QA Engineering / SDET role:
I treat test automation as software engineering, applying clean architecture and SOLID, not just "writing scripts that click buttons."
I think in terms of maintainability and scalability: adding a new feature or endpoint should require minimal changes to existing code.
I value evidence and traceability: every run produces a report, every feature is documented in Gherkin, every execution can be recorded and shared.
I'm comfortable owning a project end-to-end: from architecture decisions, to implementation, to CI-ready execution, to reporting.
I'm currently open to SDET / QA Automation Engineer opportunities where this mindset can add value to a product team. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or check more of my work on GitHub.
